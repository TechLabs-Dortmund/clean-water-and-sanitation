# Clean Water and Sanitation

### **Description**

Our project primarily focuses on clean and safe environment indicators aligned to one of the 17 sustainable development goals of the United Nations (UN). We show the current 
trends and overall situation of water consumption, sanitation, and hygiene around the world. We use several measures of central tendencies and measure of dispersion to dissect 
the data and prepare the numerous info graphs. You can create your own analysis, charts, and graphs, and maps using the simple built-in functions.


## How to Setup and Run

In order to setup the project, please proceed as follows:

Just run the **_"main"_** configuration of our code, the rest of the project is self-explanatory. The program will guide you through the next steps, enjoy! :)


## Examples
#### _Run main:_

#### _You will be asked, if you want to see all variables or just a few. Type in „few“ or „every“._

#### _Next step: Select the type of diagram. You have four options (scatterplot, barplot, lineplot and map), here we chose scatterplot:_

![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91622476/138595382-dd943bcc-2d80-4249-b799-b766f3ccb19d.png)

#### _Next you set the number of variables, you can have two or three. Here we chose two:_

#### _In a first step you have to determine the variable for the x-axis, in this case we will have the year on the x-axis._

#### _Next, you have to determine the second variable for the y-axis, as you can see we decided to choose the „basic national hygiene“._

#### _In a third step you have to choose a country and type it correctly. Here we decided to go for „Yemen“. Basically any country works, if you’re not sure about the spelling, you can have a look on the list of countries that appears after choosing the second variable._

#### _If you want to see the worldwide average fort he variable you chose, you can type „average“. Otherwise just type „finished“ for the result, that’s what we did here._

#### _After setting the last required parameter a new window will open:_

#### _The result you’ll get is a scatterplot with the proportion oft he population (%) that has access to basic national hygiene in Yemen depending on the year._

#### _You can do the same with maps as diagram type, just type „map“:_

#### _You only choose one variable, e.g. Population (thousands)._

#### _Then you have to choose the year you want to see the the population for:_

#### _A map will be created… it might take a while…_

#### _A browser window appears and you get a map where you can see the worldwide population in 2005 highlighted in different colours. A colour scale can be found at the top right._

## Roadmap

### **Next steps:**

-fixing some minor issues (e.g. adding some units of measurement wherever it's missing)

-checking the code on some hidden error triggers
 
-Working on our dropdown menu idea, since we are python/data science beginners we couldn't develop the necessary skills to include this feature in our code.
